# Triggevent

Fully event driven trigger + overlay system for FFXIV.

Makes triggers easier to develop and test.

Allows triggers to have custom configuration GUIs and overlays.

For the technical explanation of why I made this, see [Why](https://github.com/xpdota/event-trigger/wiki/Why%3F).

It even combines multiple targets with the same DoT + similar duration into one row.
